Pain point: runes and masteries
- lots of diff configs for lots of diff champions

Given an input: # of rune pages
I want to output a set of rune pages = the number of pages i currently have.
- if there are multiples that can be used for some of my fav champs, group them


Say I have 5 pages and my fav champs are
1. Cait
2. Ashe
3. Leblanc
4. Thresh
5. Alistar
6. Azir
...


Naive way: get a rune page for each of my top 5. This should be easy to do.
Next: start combining them. Ex: my 1 and 2 should be the same, so combine them and go to 6.
Next: start combining them "smartly" - my cait and ashe ones might be off by like a MS rune, but
    a well rounded portfolio of rune pages should combine these for you and get a totally diff set
    
Steps:
1. Get riot api setup (do python this time!) and a sample call working. DONE
2. Get player data and spit to screen for a username. 
- Fields we need:
    - player's rune pages
    - 
3. Get data from Champion.gg and spit to screen.
4. Start combining.
