1. get list of pro players from hardcode (50? 100?)
2. query for 15 matches per a random selection from the list (10)
    - 10 * 15 * 10players/game = 1500 datapoints
3. sort and pick out the datapoints with the inputted champ
4. get runes, output each one
    - later: put into a data structure for concise output

 tasking:
 - make a query for a sample player and get the data
 - hardcode the players
 - get a random player from the player list and make a query for his data
 - scale this to multiple players, with data rate throttling
 - get the relevant champs out of the data history
 - get the runes for the relevant champs and output them to screen
 - get the runes into a data structure
