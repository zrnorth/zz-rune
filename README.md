1. get list of pro players from hardcode (50? 100?)
2. query for 15 matches per a random selection from the list (10)
    - 10 * 15 * 10players/game = 1500 datapoints
3. sort and pick out the datapoints with the inputted champ
4. get runes, output each one
    - later: put into a data structure for concise output
